Clara
=====

Clara is a command line utility that allows you to manage your configuration files as if they were packages. In essence,
clara is a package manager like `apt`, `yum`, or `pacman`. It is designed to work with configuration files, but nothing
stops it from handling other kinds of files.

Currently, clara is in very early development. As of writing this readme, it is mostly a concept. For more information
